<p>
On some 3G dongles voice might not be enabled.
If it's the case for yours you will not be able to place phones calls.
Chances are voice can be enabled on your HUAWEI dongle with dc-unlocker
Go to www.dc-unlocker.com and download dc-unlocker client (windows)
Connect your 3G key to your PC and try to get dc-unlocker to detect it
once your manage to get your dongle detected by the software go to
unlocking -> Activate Voice (4â‚¬).
