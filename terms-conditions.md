ONOFF TELECOM reserves the right to modify the terms relating to Numbers including, as a non-restrictive example, in the event of non-compliance with these Terms of Use, or in the event of changes to the applicable legal and statutory provisions. The User might thus be asked, as a non-restrictive example, to provide additional information in order to maintain access to these Numbers.

#### 2.1.6   Cancelling Number(s)

In order to cancel one or more Number(s), the User must manually click on the “Cancel” button on the Application’s interface.

Access to the relevant Number(s) ends as soon as the User clicks on the “Cancel” button, rather than at the end of the prepaid subscription period of the Number.

If the User does not re-subscribe to the Number cancelled before the expiry of this two (2) month period, the Number cancelled disappears from the list of the Numbers to which the User may subscribe and other Users may see the Number cancelled and use it.

#### 2.1.6   Loss of Number in case of deactivation

The User acknowledges and agrees that the deactivation of Service results in the loss of the Number as well as the data related to the use of the Number (e.g. SMS, call logs, voicemails, etc.).

Indeed, during this period, the Number deactivated will remain in first position on the list of Numbers to which the User may subscribe. To subscribe to the Number deactivated, the User will have to click on the ‘Buy’ button located at the right of the Number deactivated and purchase a subscription. If the User does not subscribe before the expiry of this sixty (60) day period, the Number deactivated will be removed from the list of the Numbers to which the User may subscribe and will be made available to the other Users.

The User acknowledges and agrees that the loss of the Number triggers the loss of the data related to the use of the Number (e.g. SMS, call logs, voicemails, etc.).

2.2 Conditions of access to Services
------------------------------------

Use of the Application provided by ONOFF TELECOM requires a prior purchase of an Underlying Subscription to a mobile telephone service covering making and receiving telephone calls, and a mobile Internet package. Contracting such an Underlying Subscription, which is essential to the use of the Application, is the sole responsibility of the User. In addition, the User must provide all the necessary equipment to the use of Services, notably a terminal. The Application is compatible with terminals using a recent version of an operating system.

ONOFF TELECOM is liable neither for the satisfactory operation of the User’s equipment, nor for that of the telephone network of the operator with which the User has contracted the Underlying Subscription.

Services are delivered through the network of the operator with which the User contracted the Underlying Subscription and ONOFF TELECOM partner’s network.

#### 2.2.1   Pre-conditions to making and receiving phone calls

The User acknowledges and accepts that making and receiving phone calls requires the use of the SIM card and telephone credit provided by the operator with which the User contracted the Underlying Subscription.

Pursuant to the information given when downloading the Application and making or receiving the first phone call, the User acknowledges and accepts that calls made and received from the Application over the mobile network are discounted and/or charged by the operator with which the User contracted the Underlying Subscription, in accordance with the provisions of article 6.2.

Moreover, the User acknowledges and accepts that phone calls made and received through the Application are deducted from the Underlying Subscription or invoiced in addition where they are considered to be out of plan under the Underlying Subscription.

In the interest of clarity and transparency, ONOFF TELECOM explicitly indicates that incoming calls (received calls) from the Application are charged as outgoing calls (calls made by the User) by the operator to which the User has subscribed his Underlying Subscription at the rate determined by the said operator. It ensures the absolute confidentiality of calls made and received from the Application.

#### 2.2.2   Pre-conditions to access all Services

The User acknowledges and accepts that made and received calls, SMS, instant messages and the general use of the Services require Wifi or mobile broadband internet access and the data credit provided by the operator with which the User contracted the Underlying Subscription.

Furthermore, when the User’s terminal is not connected to a Wifi network but to a mobile broadband internet access and data credit provided by the operator with which the User contracted the Underlying Subscription, the User acknowledges and accepts that the use of the Services is charged as credit data under the Underlying Subscription or invoiced in addition where they are considered to be out of plan under the Underlying Subscription.

#### 2.3   Restrictions on use of the Application

The User must use the Application in accordance with the applicable law and is solely liable if the Application is used for fraudulent, abusive, or illegal purposes.

The User must under no circumstances:

*   Impair (and must on the contrary prevent impairment of) the Application, and in particular:
    

*   Use a process designed to deform, alter, modify, disassemble or delete the Application, its protocols and communications, such as, in particular, viruses, Trojans, worms, logic bombs, etc.;
    
*   Alter or attempt to alter the Application, its functionality or its availability;
    
*   Circumvent, deactivate or disrupt the functions relating to the Application’s security and integrity (or the integrity of any electronic equipment of any kind), or functions preventing or restricting use of the Software content;
    

*   Use an automated system to access the Application;
    
*   Download and/or share inappropriate content (illegal, offensive to human dignity, of a sexual, defamatory, injurious, racist character, or any other content which might engage the civil or criminal liability of the person or entity publishing it);
    
*   Undertake activities prejudicing the private lives of other persons, notably by misappropriating the identity of another person;
    
*   Modify, intercept or monitor any communication which is not directed at them;
    
*   Transmit broadcasts or recorded material;
    
*   Collect data from the Application allowing personal identification, including names of accounts;
    
*   Use the Application to send, or to assist other persons to send, undesirable messages. The term “undesirable messages” is understood to mean all telemarketing, promotional materials, “junk mail,” unsolicited messages, and requests for contact (“SPAM”, “SPIT or SPam over Internet Telephony”, “undesirable mail”, or misleading or mendacious content), or similar messages sent in bulk, whether in the form of emails, calls, faxes, SMS messages, instant messages or by other means;
    
*   Send or receive an excessive volume of emails, calls, faxes, SMS messages, instant messages or similar communications using the Application or Services;
    
*   Use the Application for purposes of phishing, misappropriation of identity or pharming;

*   Prejudice the intellectual property rights of ONOFF TELECOM, of another User or of a third party, and in particular:
    

*   Use in any manner whatsoever any content subject to ownership rights not belonging to the User, unless the latter holds a license or express permission from the owner of the rights;
    
*   Resell or market the Application, which is intended for the User’s personal use.
    

ONOFF TELECOM reserves the right to suspend part or all of the Application Services if the User’s use of the Application is inconsistent with normal use. For example, using the Services for a marketing campaign for commercial purposes, spamming, operation of any automated services and reselling or attempts to resell the Services to third parties all constitute an abnormal use of the Services.

ONOFF TELECOM evaluates whether the User’s use of the Services complies with normal use by reference to the Terms of Use, by comparison with other Users’ use of the Services and on the basis of predetermined indicators. Thus, for example, making more than fifteen (15) calls in less than three minutes in the same month corresponds to abnormal use.

In the event of suspected abnormal use, ONOFF TELECOM may temporarily suspend a User’s use of the Application or Services to investigate any suspected violations of these Terms of Use, and in the event of a violation, may terminate or further suspend a User’s use of the Application or Services.

#### 2.4   Updating and suspension of the Service

#### 2.4.1   Updating of the Application

The User may be obliged to install updates to continue using the Application. These updates will enable software compatibility to be maintained, will offer new functions or versions of the Application, or provide security updates or bug fixes. ONOFF TELECOM reserves the right to check the versions of the Application and to upload configuration modifications and updates of the Application. ONOFF TELECOM is under no obligation to make these updates available. These updates are therefore subject to these Terms of Use, unless these updates are accompanied by separate terms.

ONOFF TELECOM does not guarantee that the updated Application will always be compatible with older versions of the Application. Nor does ONOFF TELECOM guarantee to continue to provide maintenance for a version of an operating system or device for which the User has a license.

#### 2.4.2   Suspension and maintenance of the Service

ONOFF TELECOM reserves the right to temporarily suspend or restrict use of all or part of the Application in order to undertake operations to maintain or upgrade the Application, or the underlying infrastructure allowing use of the Application, as required for continuity of the Services, or relating to technological developments.

Other than in an emergency, temporary interruptions shall as far as possible be notified on the Website before they occur.

ONOFF TELECOM shall under no circumstances be liable for damages caused to the User if use of the Application is suspended or restricted for maintenance operations.

In order to improve the Application, ONOFF TELECOM may modify it at any time. ONOFF TELECOM may also suspend use of the Application under certain circumstances including, as non-restrictive examples, an inability to provide the Service, problems of an external origin making establishment of the Services difficult or inadvisable, technological progress, the need to modify the Service, or any other reasons set out in article 8.2. In the event of modifications the User must consequently use an updated version of the Application.

The User also acknowledges that limits on use and geographical restrictions may vary. The User is therefore advised to visit the Website regularly to obtain more detailed information on restrictions of use and recent modifications made to the Application.

In accordance with the information given when downloading the Application and making or receiving the first phone call, the User understands and accepts that calls made and received through the Application on the mobile network are invoiced pursuant to article 6.2. as part of the Underlying Subscription, by the provider with whom the Underlying Subscription was contracted.

Moreover, the User acknowledges and accepts that phone calls made and received through the Application are deducted from the Underlying Subscription or invoiced in addition where they are considered to be out of plan under the Underlying Subscription.

In the interest of clarity and transparency, ONOFF TELECOM explicitly indicates that incoming calls (received calls) from the Application are charged as outgoing calls (calls made by the User) by the operator to which the User has subscribed his Underlying Subscription at the rate determined by the said operator.

#### 6.1.4.2   Third party costs of using all Services

When the User’s terminal is not connected to a Wifi network but to a mobile broadband internet access and data credit provided by the operator with which the User contracted the Underlying Subscription, the User acknowledges and accepts that the use of the Services is charged as credit data under the Underlying Subscription or invoiced in addition where they are considered to be out of plan under the Underlying Subscription.

#### 6.1.4.3   Potential and/or additional third party costs

Payment of potential and/or additional third party costs, and in particular of roaming charges, in the event of use of the Services outside of the country where the User is established, invoiced by the network operator with which the User’s Underlying Subscription was contracted, are payable in full by the User.

The payment of third party costs is the sole responsibility of the User.

#### 6.2   Payment

#### 6.2.1   Payment Methods

A User may make payments for Services, Numbers, and Onoff Credits through a number of means, including but not limited to electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (in the case of Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (in the case of credit card or similar payments) (collectively, “Electronic Payments”).

#### 6.2.2   Automatic Renewal and Recurring Payment Policy

Users have the option to establish automatic renewal and recurring payments for their subscription to Services. To establish auto-renewal and recurring payments, a User must affirmatively opt-in through their Application distribution platform (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple Store).

By opting in to auto-renewal and recurring payments, the User:

*   understands and agrees that the User’s subscription will automatically and indefinitely renew at intervals equal to the preceding subscription period unless and until the auto-renewal options are cancelled using the process outlined below;
    
*   authorizes ONOFF TELECOM to automatically charge the User for the Numbers, Services, or OnOff Credits to which the User has subscribed, in the amount set forth in the pricing appendix, through the User’s preferred method of Electronic Payments;
    
*   understands that ONOFF TELECOM generally will charge recurring payments in advance of the new subscription term, but that it may take several days to process a charge;
    
*   understands that ONOFF TELECOM will not send User a bill before the charges are made and that it is User’s responsibility to ensure sufficient funds are available in the account at the time of each scheduled payment;
    
*   understands that if any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, ONOFF TELECOM reserves the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and to process any such payment as an Electronic Payment;
    
*   understands and agrees that each automatic renewal constitutes an acceptance by the User of the Terms of Use in effect on the date of the renewal;
    
*   understands that to cancel auto-renewal and recurring payments, a User must log-in to the applicable distribution platform (e.g., Google Play or the Apple Store) and request to cancel. Following cancellation, Users must manually renew their subscription in the manner set forth above in article 2.1.6. Cancellation before the end of the applicable subscription term is subject to the Termination - Suspension clause in article 8 and the Refund Policy in article 6.2.3.
    

Where required by law, ONOFF TELECOM will provide advance notice to Users of any material changes to the Terms of Use (including prices), and Users will have the opportunity to cancel the auto-renew option and recurring payments or terminate the Services before the beginning of the new subscription period.

#### 6.2.3   Refund Policy

Unless otherwise provided by law or these Terms of Use, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If a User believes that ONOFF TELECOM has charged the User in error, the User must contact ONOFF TELECOM within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. ONOFF TELECOM reserves the right to issue refunds or credits at its sole discretion. If ONOFF TELECOM issues a refund or credit, it is under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.

#### 6.2.4   Payment for Services

The User understands and accepts that subscription to each Service is invoiced on a prepaid basis. If the auto-renewal option is not in force, the User may renew a subscription manually by connecting to the Application before the current subscription period expires and electing to renew the subscription. Renewal of the subscription for the period selected by the User will be effective only after full payment of the subscription fee.

#### 6.2.5   Payment for Onoff Credits

If the User is established in a country in which outgoing calls and SMS require Onoff Credits, the User can buy packages of Onoff Credits and pay for them through the User’s preferred payment method. The User understands and accepts that:

*   Credits are charged in increments of one minute, and are rounded up to the next minute;
    
*   If the credits are not used for a period of thirty (30) days starting from the purchase date, they will expire. It is specified that this period is interrupted by each new purchase of Onoff Credits. In case of interruption, a new 30-day period starts to run from the date on which the User bought new Onoff Credits and applies to all Onoff Credits subscribed to by the User;
    

The User may not transfer Onoff Credits to another User Account.

7\. Changes to Terms of Use

ONOFF TELECOM reserves the right to change or modify its Terms of Use, prices, or policies at any time, subject to any applicable notice and consent requirements.

**9.2**   ONOFF TELECOM PROVIDES THIS WEBSITE, APPLICATION, SERVICES AND ANY SOFTWARE DOWNLOADED FROM THE WEBSITE, APPLICATION, OR SERVICES “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. THIS MEANS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE USER IS SOLELY LIABLE FOR THE PROTECTION, SECURITY, AND INTEGRITY OF DATA, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, AND FOR THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF USER ACCOUNT PASSWORDS AND IDENTIFIERS IN CONNECTION WITH USE OF THE SERVICES. ONOFF TELECOM SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

ONOFF TELECOM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT SOFTWARE OPERATES ON THE TYPE OF DEVICE OWNED BY THE USER AND THE USER SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING A DEVICE COMPATIBLE WITH SOFTWARE. ONOFF TELECOM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE WEBSITE, APPLICATION, OR SERVICES. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY THE USER FROM ONOFF TELECOM SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. THIS DISCLAIMER IS MADE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. SOME STATES AND COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO USERS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

**9.3**   TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WHATSOEVER SHALL ONOFF TELECOM, ITS PARENT COMPANIES, AFFILIATES, OR SUPPLIERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF SALES, PROFIT, REVENUE, GOODWILL, POSSIBILITIES, BRAND OR REPUTATION-RELATED IMAGE, CLIENTELE, TURNOVER OR DOWNTIME, OR DAMAGES FOR CONTENT, OR RELATING TO DOWNLOADING SOFTWARE, APPLICATION OR POSTING CONTENT, THE INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE APPLICATION OR SERVICES (INCLUDING TO CONTACT OR PROVIDE DETAILED LOCATION INFORMATION TO EMERGENCY SERVICES SUCH AS 911, AND ANY ACTIONS OF EMERGENCY SERVICES), ANY CONDUCT BY A THIRD-PARTY ON, OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH, THE WEBSITE, APPLICATION, OR SERVICES, OR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF THE USER’S TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT (ARISING UNDER TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHER LAW) REGARDLESS OF SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE OR WHETHER SUCH PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**9.4**   The Services offered by ONOFF TELECOM under no circumstances may replace the primary mobile telephone service provided by the operator with which the User contracted the Underlying Subscription. The User therefore understands and accepts that the Numbers do not make it possible to make a call to all categories of numbers.

ONOFF TELECOM reserves the right to allow users to make calls to additional classes of numbers after the launch of the Services.

**9.5**   ONOFF TELECOM’s total liability towards a professional User (pursuant to the Contract) shall not be greater, all categories of prejudice combined, than the total sum paid by the User for products within the twelve-month (12-month) period immediately preceding the date of the causal event having led to the action in question.

10\. Force majeure

11\. Resolution of disputes – Applicable law
--------------------------------------------

#### 11.1   Mandatory, Bilateral, and Binding Arbitration

Please read this carefully. It affects User rights. User and ONOFF TELECOM agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating in any way to the User’s use of ONOFF TELECOM service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by ONOFF TELECOM or through ONOFF TELECOM websites or mobile applications, including any dispute or claim as to the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be resolved only by final and binding, bilateral arbitration, except that (1) User may assert claims in small claims court if User's claims qualify; and (2) this agreement to arbitrate does not include User’s or ONOFF TELECOM’s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the Choice of Law & Jurisdiction provision above, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement and govern all questions as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use.

The term “Dispute” shall include any dispute, claim, or controversy between the User and ONOFF TELECOM regarding or relating to any aspect of the User's relationship with ONOFF TELECOM, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term “Dispute” also includes, but is not limited to, any and all claims between the User and ONOFF TELECOM in any way related to or concerning these Terms of Use, ONOFF TELECOM’s services, products, any billing disputes or disputes involving or relating to telephone calls or other communications that the User claims were received by the User from ONOFF TELECOM and/or a party acting on ONOFF TELECOM’s behalf. The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. As used in this Section, “ONOFF TELECOM” means ONOFF TELECOM and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.

#### 11.2   Dispute Notice

Before initiating an arbitration, the User and ONOFF TELECOM each agree to first provide the other a written notice (“Notice of Dispute”), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. A Notice of Dispute can be (1) mailed to \[INSERT MAILING ADDRESS\] (the “Notice Address”), (2) emailed at legal@onoffapp.com, (3) submitted by visiting \[LINK) ONOFF TELECOM will provide a Notice of Dispute to the User via mailing address or email address associated with the User’s ONOFF TELECOM account.

The User and ONOFF TELECOM agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration and not to commence and arbitration proceeding until a 45-day post-notice resolution period expires. If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the User or ONOFF TELECOM may commence an arbitration proceeding.

#### 11.3   Arbitration Process and Procedure

All Disputes shall be determined by binding arbitration (1) administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”), and as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules regarding filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator fees; (2) conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator; and (3) take place telephonically, unless an in-person hearing is specifically requested by either party, in such case in-person hearings shall take place in the county where the User resides. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (the “Minimum Standards”), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.

Disputes may also be referred to another arbitration organization if the User and ONOFF TELECOM agree in writing, or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act. 9 U.S.C. §1-16.  

We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, or representative action.

THE USER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, THE USER AND ONOFF TELECOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION FOR ANY DISPUTE COVERED BY THESE TERMS OF USE.

The JAMS Rules are available on its website at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. Notwithstanding any JAMS Rules to the contrary or any other provision in the arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern, the User and ONOFF TELECOM each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide, except that a court (and not the arbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.

To commence an arbitration, a Demand for Arbitration is required to be executed and served on ONOFF TELECOM. Service of the Demand for Arbitration on ONOFF TELECOM can be mailed to \[INSERT ADDRESS\] pursuant to the instructions provided by JAMS to submit a Dispute for arbitration. Service of the Demand for Arbitration on the User will be sent to the Notice Address. Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration can be found at www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS\_Arbitration\_Demand.pdf. ONOFF TELECOM will bear the cost of the User’s initial filing fee.

#### 11.4   Class Action Waiver

NEITHER THE USER NOR ONOFF TELECOM SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE. Further, unless both the User and ONOFF TELECOM expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claim. If this prohibition of class, representative, or consolidated arbitration is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right to a jury trial.

#### 11.5   Arbitrator Selection

Arbitration will be conducted by one neutral arbitrator selected with the participation and involvement of both ONOFF TELECOM and the User pursuant to JAMS Rule 12.

#### 11.6   Arbitrator Award

An arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement of the disposition of each Dispute and a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusion on which the award is based. The arbitrator’s decision and award are final and binding, subject only to the limited court review permitted under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

#### 11.7   Fees

In the event the User commences arbitration, after ONOFF TELECOM receives notice that the User has initiated arbitration, ONOFF TELECOM will promptly reimburse the User for the User’s payment of the filing fee and ONOFF TELECOM will pay the JAMS any case management fees associated with the arbitration and the professional fees for the arbitrator’s services.

12\. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction
-----------------------------------

These Terms of Use shall be interpreted, construed, enforced, and governed in all aspects in accordance with the exclusive jurisdiction and laws of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any suit, cause of action, or legal proceeding arising under or relating to these Terms of Use or the User’s uses of any ONOFF TELECOM service that is not addressed through arbitration or in small claims court as provided below, shall be in the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts of New York, situated in New York County, New York or the federal courts situated in the Southern District of New York.
